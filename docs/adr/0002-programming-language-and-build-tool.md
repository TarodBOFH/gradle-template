# Use Kotlin with Gradle 6 as language and build tool

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to choose a programming language and build tool to work on this project.

## Considered Options

* Java
* Kotlin
* Maven
* Gradle

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Kotlin + Gradle", because

* Development cycle is fast and code is clear
* We feel comfortable with the stack
* Brings an opportunity to learn new stuff that came out in Gradle 6
* We can use the same language in the build scripts if needed
* We have experience with it
